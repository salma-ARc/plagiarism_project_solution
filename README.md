# plagiarism_project_solution
in this repository you will find the code with solutions i worked on for the plagiarism_project i had to finish for the AWS machine learning program offered by udacity 
here you will find 2 versions of each notebook file with the .py extention and the html extention .
beside a script 'train' which includes all the functions and the model chosen to train the dataset , in fact i also had to correct some of the kinda errors on code due to old version python issues like the 'import joblib ' directly .
i will be adding all the needed files in the near future .
